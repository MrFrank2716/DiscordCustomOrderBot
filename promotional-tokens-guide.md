# üé´ Promotional Token System Guide

## Overview
The Discord Order Bot includes a comprehensive promotional token system designed for marketing campaigns, special offers, and customer incentives. This guide covers everything from token creation to campaign management.

## üéØ System Purpose

### What Promotional Tokens Do

4. **Automatic validation** - bot checks token validity during order creation
5. **Usage tracking** - tokens are marked as used when orders complete
6. **Campaign analysis** - admins can review token usage statistics

## üõí Token Integration with Orders

### Customer Token Redemption
When customers have promotional tokens:

1. **Customer provides token code** to staff member
2. **Staff uses enhanced `/createorder` command** with token parameter:
   ```
   /createorder description:"Order details" customer:@customer token_code:A1B2C
   ```
3. **Automatic validation** occurs:
   - Bot checks if token exists
   - Verifies token is unused
   - Shows clear error if invalid
4. **Order creation succeeds** with token association
5. **Visual confirmation** shows token was applied

### Order Completion and Token Usage
When orders with tokens are completed:

1. **Automatic token marking**: Token status changes from "Available" to "Used"
2. **Usage tracking**: Records customer ID, order code, and completion timestamp
3. **Audit trail**: Complete history for campaign analysis
4. **Visual confirmation**: Completion message shows token was processed

### Error Handling
- **Token not found**: Clear message if code doesn't exist
- **Token already used**: Shows when and by whom token was previously used
- **Invalid format**: Guidance on correct token code format
- **System errors**: Graceful handling with user-friendly messages

## üîí Security and Best Practices

### Security Features

- **Permission validation**: Commands verify user authorization before execution

### Best Practices for Administrators

#### Token Creation
- **Use descriptive names**: Make it easy to identify campaigns later
- **Include expiration dates**: Add validity periods in notes field
- **Document conditions**: Clearly state any restrictions or limitations
- **Plan distribution method**: Know how tokens will reach customers

#### Distribution Security
- **Physical token security**: Store blank promotional materials securely
- **Limited access**: Only trusted staff should handle token codes
- **Track distribution**: Document who received tokens and when
- **Monitor for fraud**: Watch for suspicious usage patterns

#### Campaign Monitoring
- **Regular usage checks**: Monitor redemption rates throughout campaign
- **Customer service readiness**: Train staff on token validation procedures
- **Issue resolution**: Have clear procedures for handling token problems
- **Data backup**: Ensure token data is included in regular backups

#### Campaign Cleanup
- **Timely removal**: Remove expired tokens promptly after campaigns end
- **Clear removal reasons**: Document why tokens are being removed
- **Usage analysis**: Review campaign effectiveness before cleanup
- **Archive information**: Save campaign summaries for future reference

### Common Security Considerations

#### Fraud Prevention
- **One-time use**: Tokens automatically become invalid after use
- **No replication**: Used tokens cannot be duplicated or reused
- **Usage tracking**: Complete audit trail for investigation
- **Admin oversight**: All token operations require administrative approval

#### Data Protection
- **Secure storage**: Token data is stored in encrypted JSON files
- **Access control**: Only authorized administrators can manage tokens
- **Audit logging**: All operations are logged for security review
- **Backup inclusion**: Token data is included in automated backups

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Token Generation Problems
**Issue**: Token generation fails or returns error
- **Check permissions**: Verify admin role is configured correctly
- **Storage space**: Ensure sufficient disk space for data files
- **File permissions**: Verify bot can write to data directory
- **System restart**: Restart bot if persistent issues occur

#### Token Validation Issues
**Issue**: Valid tokens show as invalid during order creation
- **Case sensitivity**: Ensure token code is entered exactly as generated
- **Timing issues**: Allow time for data synchronization after token creation
- **Data corruption**: Check data files for corruption or restore from backup
- **Command syntax**: Verify correct usage of `/createorder` with token parameter

#### Customer Service Issues
**Issue**: Customer claims token isn't working
- **Verify token exists**: Use `/checktoken` to confirm token is in system
- **Check usage status**: Confirm token hasn't already been used
- **Validate code accuracy**: Ensure customer is providing correct code
- **Review campaign validity**: Check if campaign is still active

#### System Performance Issues
**Issue**: Token commands are slow or unresponsive
- **Data file size**: Large token files may impact performance
- **Memory usage**: Monitor bot memory usage during peak periods
- **Network connectivity**: Verify stable connection to Discord servers
- **Regular maintenance**: Perform periodic cleanup of expired tokens

### Error Messages and Meanings
